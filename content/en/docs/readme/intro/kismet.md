Kismet is an open source sniffer, WIDS, wardriver, and packet capture tool for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, BTLE, wireless thermometers, airplanes, power meters, Zigbee, and more.

Kismet runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL).

Kismet can operate both headless as a standalone capture and WIDS system, or with a full modern web-based UI.

Kismet can be run on a wide range of hardware, from the very small to large servers, depending on the amount of traffic you plan to capture.
