    *WARNING* - You will *not* be able to capture from the built-in Wi-Fi on a 
    Raspberry Pi unless you also install the [nexmon driver](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon).
    This patch adds reverse-engineered monitor mode to the Broadcom drivers.

    You will still likely see better performance and stability with an external 
    USB device.

  notes: |
    Due to limitations in the packages and versions of libraries in Ubuntu Bionic, 
    these packages do not contain all features.  You may be able to manually install 
    new versions of the required libraries and compile from source, instead. 

    The following features are not available in Bionic packages: 
      
    * Remote capture via websockets 

      A Bionic install cannot function as a remote capture node feeding a Kismet server 
      over websockets. 

      TCP mode is still available. 

      A Bionic Kismet server supports receiving remote captures over websockets, only 
      client-mode websockets are impacted.
