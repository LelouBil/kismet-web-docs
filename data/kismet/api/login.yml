    This API is used by the Kismet web UI, and is available for other alternate full-UI replacements.  It is 
    used to indicate if Kismet has been configured fully. 

    Kismet does not provide a default username or password; instead, if the user has not configured a static 
    account in a configuration file, the UI is expected to prompt the user during the first-tine startup. 

    The majority of API endpoints will not be available if the account setup process has not been completed.
  response: | 
    Basic document with success state communicated via HTTP error codes.
  results:
    - [200, "if the initial login setup has been completed"]
    - [406, "if the the credentials are hard-coded into a configuration file"]
    - [-1, "if the initial setup has not been completed and the user must configure a password to continue"]
  notes: |
    If the password is set in the Kismet configuration files, this API will not be available 
    and will return `HTTP 406`

    Configure the initial login. 

    This causes Kismet to store the initial login in the settings file in the users home directory.
  response: | 
    Basic document with success state communicated via HTTP error codes.
  results:
    - [200, "if the login configuration succeeds"]
    - [406, "if the the server password is hard-coded into a configuration file"]
    - [-1, "if the login information could not be set for some other reason"]
  notes: |
    Setting the initial password does not require a login. 

    Subsequent attempts to change the login and password will require a valid login 
    session.

    Changing the password does not invalidate any current login sessions.  

    If the password is set in the global Kismet configuration files, such as 
    `kismet_httpd.conf` or `kismet_site.conf`, this API will not be available 
    and will return `HTTP 406`
