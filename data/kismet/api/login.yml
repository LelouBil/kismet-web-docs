  name: "First-time login check"
  uri: "/session/check-setup-ok"
  added: "2019-01"
  methods: ["GET"]
  types: []
  roles: ["n/a"]
  docs: |
    This API is used by the Kismet web UI, and is available for other alternate full-UI replacements.  It is 
    used to indicate if Kismet has been configured fully. 

    Kismet does not provide a default username or password; instead, if the user has not configured a static 
    account in a configuration file, the UI is expected to prompt the user during the first-tine startup. 

    The majority of API endpoints will not be available if the account setup process has not been completed.
  response: | 
    Basic document with success state communicated via HTTP error codes.
  results:
    - [200, "if the initial login setup has been completed"]
    - [406, "if the the credentials are hard-coded into a configuration file"]
    - [-1, "if the initial setup has not been completed and the user must configure a password to continue"]
  notes: |
    If the password is set in the Kismet configuration files, this API will not be available 
    and will return `HTTP 406`

-
  name: "Set login and password"
  uri: "/session/set_password"
  added: "2019-01"
  methods: ["POST"]
  types: []
  roles: ["n/a", "admin"]
  docs: |
    Configure the initial login. 

    This causes Kismet to store the initial login in the settings file in the users home directory.
  parameters:
    -
      name: "username" 
      type: "string"
      required: true 
      description: "Username used for standard web login.  This user will have the `admin` role."
    -
      name: "password" 
      type: "string" 
      required: true 
      description: "Password string for admin user login."
  response: | 
    Basic document with success state communicated via HTTP error codes.
  results:
    - [200, "if the login configuration succeeds"]
    - [406, "if the the server password is hard-coded into a configuration file"]
    - [-1, "if the login information could not be set for some other reason"]
  notes: |
    Setting the initial password does not require a login. 

    Subsequent attempts to change the login and password will require a valid login 
    session.

    Changing the password does not invalidate any current login sessions.  

    If the password is set in the global Kismet configuration files, such as 
    `kismet_httpd.conf` or `kismet_site.conf`, this API will not be available 
    and will return `HTTP 406`

  name: "Checking sessions"
  uri: "/session/check_session"
  methods: ["GET"]
  types: []
  roles: ["n/a"]
  docs: |
    If a UI or script has a saved session, it can use this endpoint to check if the session is still valid and take an 
    appropriate action (such as using a saved login or prompting the user to log in again) if it is no longer valid. 

    If basic auth data also provided, a new login will be created and returned if the session is no longer valid.
  results:
    - [200, "if the session is valid or valid login data is provided"]
    - [-1, "if the session is not valid and there is no supplied login data or the login data is not valid"]

-
  name: "Checking login"
  uri: "/session/check_login"
  types: []
  methods: ["GET"]
  roles: ["n/a"]
  docs: |
    A UI or script may need to check for a valid login and prompt the user to take an appropriate action if the login 
    credentials are not valid. 

    Most likely, the session check API is more appropriate as it will return a valid session simultaneously if the 
    login is valid. 
  results:
    - [200, "if the login is valid"]
    - [-1, "if the login is invalid"]

  name: "Listing API tokens"
  uri: "/auth/apikey/list"
  types: ["anyjson"]
  added: "2020-11"
  methods: ["GET"]
  roles: ["admin"]
  docs: | 
    Fetch a list of created API tokens, descriptions, and associated roles. 

    If `httpd_allow_auth_view` is set to `false` in the Kismet configuration, the results *will not include* the API 
    tokens, and the user must look at the Kismet configuration files to view previously created API keys.
  results:
    - [200, "and a JSON array of provisioned API keys"]
    - [-1, "on failure"]

-
  name: "Creating API tokens"
  uri: "/auth/apikey/generate"
  types: ["cmd"]
  added: "2020-11" 
  methods: ["POST"]
  roles: ["admin"]
  docs: | 
    Create a new API token and assign it a role. 

    New API tokens can *only* be generated if the `httpd_allow_auth_creation` option is set to `true` in the 
    Kismet config.  This is set by default. 

    If `httpd_allow_auth_view` is not set to `true` in the Kismet configuration, API tokens may only be viewed 
    at the time of creation, or by inspecting the session file in the users Kismet configuration directory.
  parameters:
    -
      name: "name"
      type: "string"
      required: true
      description: "Name of API key; each API key must have a unique name."
    - 
      name: "role" 
      type: "string" 
      required: true 
      description: "Role of API key; this will restrict what the key is allowed to access."
    - 
      name: "duration" 
      type: "string"
      required: true 
      description: "Duration, in seconds, of token validity, from the time of token creation (now).  May be 0 for a permanent token."
  results: 
    - [200, "a plain-text response of the newly created token on sucess"]
    - [-1, "on failure"]
  notes: |
    `httpd_allow_auth_creation` must be `true` or this API will return an error condition.

    Users should be prompted to copy the API token at the time of creation.

-
  name: "Revoking API tokens"
  uri: "/auth/apikey/revoke"
  types: ["cmd"]
  added: "2020-11"
  methods: ["POST"]
  roles: ["admin"]
  docs: |
    Revoke and delete an API token. 

    All active sessions using the token will be revoked and future sessions prevented.

    If `httpd_allow_auth_creation` is not set in the Kismet configuration, this API will return an error.
  parameters:
    - 
      name: "name" 
      type: "string"
      required: true 
      description: "Name of API token to revoke"
  results:
    - [200, "on success"]
    - [-1, "on failure"]
