    Mirroring the [device view](/docs/api/device_views/) api, the SSID summarization endpoint is the primary interface for clients to access the SSID list and for scripts to retrieve lists of SSIDs.

    The SSID summarization is best utilized when applying a view window via the start and length variables.
